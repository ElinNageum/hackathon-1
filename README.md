<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

**Save-on-Eats** is a full-stack website application that solves the day-to-day problems of individuals -- preparing meal -- by using generative AI and AWS Services to reduce food and energy waste and grocery bills.

### Problem 

- We can waste a lot of time thinking of what meals to make and waste a lot of energy shopping at different grocery stores for the best deal
- Food that is unsold at grocery stores and leftover at homes will be thrown out and wasted
- Groceries are increasingly expensive now

### Solution

Features of our app:
- Prompts user for location and cuisine 
- Scrapes online flyers to find discounted items
- Generates meal plan that uses discount items 

### Impact

- Reduces carbon footprint by saving user trips to different grocery stores
- Reduces food waste by increasing amount of discounted items sold and by limiting amount of extra groceries that ends up unused at home
- Reduces grocery bills for the user

### Context of Sustainability
- Reducing Food Waste (Environment)
- Lowering Carbon Footprint (Viable)
- Encouraging Cost-Effective, Eco-Friendly Choices (Economic)
- Optimized Meal Planning for Resource Efficiency (Environment)
